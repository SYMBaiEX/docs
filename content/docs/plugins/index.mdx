# Plugins

ElizaOS plugins extend the capabilities of your agents with custom actions, providers, services, and more. The plugin system in v1.2.0 provides a comprehensive framework for building and distributing reusable functionality.

The plugin ecosystem includes 130+ available plugins across various categories, from core functionality to specialized integrations, making it easy to extend your agents with powerful capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

Create a new plugin using the ElizaOS CLI:

```bash
elizaos create my-plugin --type plugin
cd plugin-my-plugin
elizaos dev
```

### Plugin Features

ElizaOS plugins support a wide range of features:

- **Actions**: Define what your agent can do
- **Providers**: Supply data and context
- **Services**: Handle background processing
- **Events**: Respond to system events
- **Routes**: Create HTTP endpoints
- **Models**: Integrate custom AI models
- **Tests**: Comprehensive testing framework

## Available Plugins

## Advanced Features

### AI-Powered Plugin Generation

  dependencies: ['@elizaos/plugin-knowledge'],
  // ... other properties
};
```

### Event System

React to system events:

```typescript
export const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  events: {
    MESSAGE_RECEIVED: [
      async (params) => {
        // Handle message received
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Publishing

Share your plugins with the community:

```bash
# Test publishing
elizaos publish --test

# Publish to registry
elizaos publish
```
