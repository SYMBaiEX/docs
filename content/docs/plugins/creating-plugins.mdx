# Creating Plugins

This guide shows you how to quickly create new plugins for elizaOS using the CLI tools. For detailed information about plugin architecture and components, see the [Plugin System Architecture](/docs/core-concepts/architecture/plugin-system).

## Quick Start

elizaOS provides two approaches for creating plugins using the CLI:

### Option 1: Full Project Structure

Creates a complete project with sample agent and plugin:

```bash
elizaos create my-project -t project
```

This option:
- Provides a complete project structure
- Includes a sample agent character
- Requires importing local plugin code before publishing
- Best for developing standalone agent projects

### Option 2: Minimal Plugin

Creates only a plugin in publishable format:

```bash
elizaos create my-plugin -t plugin
```

This option:
- Creates a minimal plugin structure
- Ready for immediate publishing
- Best for creating reusable plugins
- No agent character required

## Testing Your Plugin

After creating your plugin, test it locally:

```bash
elizaos dev
```

This command:
- Starts a development server
- Loads your plugin automatically
- Provides hot reloading for development
- Shows debug information

## Plugin Structure

Both options create a standard plugin structure:

```
my-plugin/
├── src/
│   ├── actions/       # Plugin actions
│   ├── evaluators/    # Plugin evaluators
│   ├── providers/     # Context providers
│   ├── services/      # Background services
│   ├── index.ts       # Plugin entry point
│   └── plugin.ts      # Plugin definition
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Your Approach**: Decide between full project or minimal plugin based on your needs
2. **Create Your Plugin**: Run the appropriate `elizaos create` command
3. **Develop**: Add your custom actions, evaluators, providers, and services
4. **Test**: Use `elizaos dev` to test your plugin locally
5. **Publish**: Share your plugin with the community

## Key Considerations

- **Full Project**: Choose this if you're building a complete agent with custom functionality
- **Minimal Plugin**: Choose this if you're creating reusable functionality for multiple agents
- **Local Development**: Always test thoroughly with `elizaos dev` before publishing
- **Documentation**: Include clear documentation for your plugin's features

## Examples

### Creating a Weather Plugin

```bash
# Create the plugin
elizaos create weather-plugin -t plugin

# Navigate to the plugin directory
cd weather-plugin

# Test the plugin
elizaos dev
```

### Creating a Full Agent Project

```bash
# Create the project
elizaos create my-assistant -t project

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-assistant

# Test the agent with plugin
elizaos dev
```

## Publishing Your Plugin

Once your plugin is ready:

1. Update `package.json` with your plugin details
2. Write comprehensive documentation
3. Add examples and tests
4. Publish to npm or your preferred registry
