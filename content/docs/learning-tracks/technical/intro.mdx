## Technical Track Introduction

Welcome to the Technical Learning Track for ElizaOS!

This comprehensive track is designed for developers who want to build sophisticated AI agents using
ElizaOS. You'll learn to architect scalable agent systems, build custom plugins, and deploy at
scale.

## Who This Track Is For

- **Full-stack developers** looking to build AI applications
- **System architects** designing agent-based systems
- **Plugin developers** creating custom functionality
- **DevOps engineers** deploying agent infrastructure
- **Researchers** exploring AI agent architectures
- **Technical innovators** pushing the boundaries of AI

## Prerequisites

Before starting this track, you should have:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript proficiency** - Strong understanding of modern JS/TS
- **Node.js ecosystem understanding** - NPM, modules, async programming
- **Async programming experience** - Promises, async/await, event loops
- **Git and GitHub familiarity** - Version control and collaboration
- **Basic AI/LLM concepts** - Understanding of language models and embeddings
- **REST API knowledge** - HTTP, API design, authentication

## Main Learning Objectives

By the end of this track, you'll be able to:

- **Architect scalable agent systems** with proper state management
- **Build custom plugins** with actions, evaluators, and providers
- **Integrate with platforms** like Discord, Twitter, and custom APIs
- **Optimize performance** for high-throughput agent operations
- **Implement advanced features** like memory systems and knowledge management
- **Deploy at scale** with proper monitoring and error handling
- **Thoroughly test agents** with comprehensive test suites

## Track Structure

6. **Testing** - Learn comprehensive testing strategies

### Phase 3: Advanced (2-3 hours)

7. **Performance Optimization** - Scale and optimize your agents
8. **Platform Integration** - Connect to external services
9. **Production Deployment** - Deploy robust, scalable systems

## Development Philosophy

This track emphasizes:

- **TypeScript-first development** for type safety and maintainability
- **Comprehensive testing** at all levels
- **Performance optimization** from the ground up
- **Community involvement** and open-source contribution
- **Security best practices** for production deployments
