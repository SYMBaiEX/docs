## Creating Your Agent's Character

Give your agent a unique personality that shines through in every conversation!

## Understanding Characters

A character file defines:

- **Who** your agent is (name, background)
- **How** they communicate (style, tone)
- **What** they talk about (topics, interests)

## Basic Character Structure

Here's the simplest character file:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Agent Name",
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-sql", "@elizaos/plugin-openai", "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"],
  "bio": [
    "A brief description of who your agent is",
    "Their background or story",
    "What makes them unique"
  ],
  "style": {
    "all": ["friendly", "helpful"]
  }
}
```

<Callout type="error" title="Critical Plugin Order Requirements">
The `plugins` array must include these three plugins in this **exact order**:

1. **`@elizaos/plugin-sql`** - Database functionality (MUST BE FIRST!)
2. **Model provider plugin** - One of:
   - `@elizaos/plugin-openai`
   - `@elizaos/plugin-anthropic`
   - `@elizaos/plugin-ollama`
3. **`@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`** - Core messaging and interaction capabilities

**SECURITY WARNING**: Incorrect plugin ordering can cause:

- Database connection failures
- Memory leaks
- Undefined behavior
- Agent crashes

**WRONG ORDER** (will fail):

```json
"plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap", "@elizaos/plugin-openai", "@elizaos/plugin-sql"]
```

**CORRECT ORDER**:

```json
"plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-sql", "@elizaos/plugin-openai", "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"]
```

</Callout>

## Step-by-Step Character Creation

<Steps>
<Step>

### Choose a Name

Pick something memorable and fitting:

```json
"name": "Luna"
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Write the Biography

Tell your agent's story (2-5 sentences):

```json
"bio": [
  "Luna is a cosmic explorer AI who loves astronomy and space.",
  "She spent years analyzing data from telescopes around the world.",
  "Now she shares her passion for the cosmos with everyone she meets!"
]
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Define Personality Traits

List 3-7 personality traits:

```json
"style": {
  "all": ["curious", "enthusiastic", "knowledgeable", "encouraging", "whimsical"]
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Add Favorite Topics

What does your agent love to discuss?

```json
"topics": ["space", "astronomy", "science", "exploration", "the universe", "stars"]
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Create Example Conversations

Show how your agent should respond using the proper message format:

```json
"messageExamples": [
  [
    {
      "name": "{{user1}}",
      "content": {
        "text": "Tell me about the moon"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Luna",
      "content": {
        "text": "Oh, the Moon is fascinating! Did you know it's moving away from Earth at about 3.8 cm per year?"
      }
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "name": "{{user1}}",
      "content": {
        "text": "That's cool!"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Luna",
      "content": {
        "text": "Right? And here's something even cooler - the Moon's gravity causes our ocean tides! Nature is amazing!"
      }
    }
  ]
]
```

## Customization Tips

### Environment Variable Integration

Make your character adaptable with environment variables:

```json
{
  "name": "${CHARACTER_NAME:-DefaultBot}",
  "bio": [
    "I'm ${CHARACTER_NAME:-your assistant}",
    "I work in ${ENVIRONMENT:-development} mode",
    "My creator is ${CREATOR_NAME:-Anonymous}"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "model": "${MODEL_PROVIDER:-openai}",
    "temperature": "${MODEL_TEMPERATURE:-0.7}",
    "maxTokens": "${MAX_TOKENS:-2000}",
    "secrets": {
      "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}",
      "DISCORD_TOKEN": "${DISCORD_TOKEN}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Character-Specific Environment Variables

Use namespaced environment variables for multiple characters:

```bash
# .env file
CHARACTER.luna.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-luna-specific-key
CHARACTER.luna.PERSONALITY=curious
CHARACTER.luna.EXPERTISE=astronomy

CHARACTER.helper.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-helper-specific-key

**Friendly Types**: warm, welcoming, cheerful, kind, caring **Professional Types**: efficient,
knowledgeable, reliable, focused **Creative Types**: imaginative, artistic, whimsical, inspiring
**Fun Types**: playful, humorous, witty, entertaining, silly

### Voice & Tone

Add specific communication styles:

```json
"style": {
  "all": ["friendly", "casual"],
  "chat": ["conversational", "warm"],
  "post": ["engaging", "concise"]
}
```

### Special Behaviors

Make your agent unique:

```json
"postExamples": [
  "Just discovered something amazing! Did you know...",
  "Daily reminder: You're capable of incredible things!",
  "Fun fact of the day..."
]
```

## Where to Save Your Character

Save your character file as:

<Files>
  <Folder name="my-agent">
    <Folder name="agent">
      <File name="character.json" />
    </Folder>
    <File name=".env" />
    <File name="package.json" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

<Tabs items={["Basic Structure", "Advanced Structure", "Multi-Character"]}>
  <Tab value="Basic Structure">
    ```
    my-agent/
    ├── agent/
    │   └── character.json
    ├── .env
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Advanced Structure">
    ```

## Testing Your Character

1. Save your changes
2. Restart your agent: `bun start`
3. Have a conversation
4. Adjust based on responses

## Pro Tips

### DO

- Give specific examples of speech patterns
- Include 5-10 message examples
- Be consistent with personality
- Add unique catchphrases or quirks

### DON'T

- Make the bio too long (keep it under 5 sentences)
- Use conflicting traits (e.g., "shy" and "outgoing")
- Forget to test your changes
- Copy someone else's character exactly

## Quick Templates

### The Educator

```json
"style": { "all": ["patient", "knowledgeable", "encouraging", "clear"] }
```

### The Entertainer

```json
"style": { "all": ["funny", "energetic", "playful", "engaging"] }
```

### The Professional

```json
"style": { "all": ["professional", "efficient", "reliable", "concise"] }
```

### The Friend

```json
"style": { "all": ["warm", "supportive", "understanding", "genuine"] }
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I change personality later?** A: Yes! Just edit the file and restart.

**Q: How many traits should I use?** A: 3-7 traits work best. Too many can be confusing.

**Q: Can I use emojis?** A: Yes! Add them in bio or examples for more personality.

**Q: What if my agent sounds generic?** A: Add more specific examples and unique phrases!

## Security & Performance Considerations

### Security Best Practices

<Callout type="warning" title="API Key Security">
**Never** hardcode API keys in your character files! Always use environment variables:

```bash
# In your .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key
```

```json
// In character.json - reference environment variables
{
  "settings": {
    "secrets": {
      "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

</Callout>

### Performance Optimization

- **Bio Length**: Keep bio arrays under 10 items for optimal performance
- **Message Examples**: Limit to 15-20 examples to prevent memory issues
- **Knowledge Files**: Use specific, focused knowledge rather than large documents
- **Plugin Count**: Only include necessary plugins to reduce startup time

### Validation Requirements

Always validate your character file before deployment:

```bash
# Validate character structure
bun run validate-character character.json

# Test character responses
bun run test-character character.json
```

### Common Security Pitfalls

**Don't**:

- Share character files with embedded secrets
- Use broad permissions in plugin settings
- Include sensitive information in bio/lore
- Store credentials in version control

**Do**:

- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper access controls
- Review plugin permissions regularly
- Use character-specific API keys when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors & Solutions

#### "Plugin order error"

**Error**: `Plugin @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap must come after @elizaos/plugin-sql` **Solution**:
Ensure correct plugin order: SQL → Model Provider → Bootstrap

#### "Invalid messageExamples format"

**Error**: `messageExamples must be array of conversation arrays` **Solution**: Use proper object
format with `name` and `content.text` fields

#### "Character validation failed"

**Error**: `Bio must be string or array of strings` **Solution**: Check bio format - use either
string or array of strings

#### "Model provider not found"

**Error**: `No model provider plugin found` **Solution**: Include exactly one model provider plugin
in correct position

### Debugging Tools

```bash
# Check character file syntax
bun run lint-character character.json

# Validate plugin compatibility
bun run check-plugins character.json

# Test message examples
bun run test-examples character.json
```

### Performance Issues

If your agent is slow:

1. Reduce bio array length
2. Limit message examples
3. Check plugin count
4. Optimize knowledge files
5. Review system prompt length

## Next Steps

Now that you have a character:

1. Browse available plugins for extra features
2. Connect to Discord or Twitter
3. Deploy your agent online

Remember: The best characters feel real and consistent. Have fun creating your unique AI
personality!
