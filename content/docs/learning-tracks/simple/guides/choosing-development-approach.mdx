title: Choosing Your Development Approach
description: Learn when to use standalone agent projects versus monorepo development for Eliza
---

When building with Eliza, you have two primary development approaches: **standalone agent projects**
and **monorepo development**. This guide will help you choose the right approach based on your needs
and technical expertise.

## Quick Decision Guide

### Use Standalone Agent Project If You Are:

- **A Vibecoder** focusing on character creation and personality
- Building a single agent with specific functionality
- New to development or prefer simpler setups
- Working independently or in a small team
- Prioritizing quick deployment and iteration
- Not planning extensive custom plugin development

### Use Monorepo If You Are:

- **A Developer** building multiple agents or complex systems
- Creating custom plugins and providers
- Contributing to Eliza core
- Managing multiple related projects
- Working in a larger team with shared code
- Need advanced tooling and dependency management

## Standalone Agent Projects

### What Is It?

A standalone agent project is a separate repository containing just your agent's configuration,
character files, and minimal custom code. It uses Eliza as a dependency.

### Benefits

- **Simple Setup**: Get started in minutes with minimal configuration
- **Clear Focus**: All files relate directly to your agent
- **Easy Deployment**: Straightforward deployment process
- **Low Complexity**: No need to understand the entire Eliza codebase
- **Quick Iteration**: Make changes without affecting other projects

### Best For

- Character designers and creative developers
- Single-purpose agents (Discord bots, Twitter agents, etc.)
- Proof of concepts and experiments
- Learning Eliza basics
- Projects with minimal custom code

### Example Structure

```
my-agent/
├── src/
│   ├── character.json    # Agent personality
│   └── index.ts         # Entry point
├── .env                 # Environment variables
├── package.json         # Dependencies
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the standalone template
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza-starter my-agent
cd my-agent

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure your agent
# Edit src/character.json

# Run your agent
npm start
```

## Monorepo Development

### What Is It?

Monorepo development means working within the main Eliza repository or a fork, managing multiple
packages and agents in a single codebase.

### Benefits

- **Code Sharing**: Reuse components across multiple agents
- **Unified Development**: All projects in one place
- **Better Tooling**: Advanced build and test infrastructure
- **Contribution Ready**: Easy to contribute back to Eliza
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript definitions
- **Synchronized Versions**: Consistent dependency versions

### Best For

- Building multiple interconnected agents
- Developing custom plugins and providers
- Contributing to Eliza core
- Enterprise deployments
- Complex agent networks
- Teams with multiple developers

### Example Structure

```
eliza/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/           # Core Eliza functionality
│   ├── plugins/        # Shared plugins
│   └── client-*/       # Various clients
├── agents/
│   ├── agent-1/        # First agent
│   ├── agent-2/        # Second agent
│   └── shared/         # Shared agent code
├── scripts/            # Build and deployment scripts
└── package.json        # Workspace configuration
```

### Getting Started

```bash
# Fork and clone Eliza
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eliza
cd eliza

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create a new agent
cd agents
mkdir my-agent
# ... configure your agent

# Run from monorepo
pnpm --filter my-agent dev
```

## Comparison Table

| Aspect                   | Standalone  | Monorepo     |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Setup Complexity**     | Low         | High         |
| **Learning Curve**       | Gentle      | Steep        |
| **Code Sharing**         | Limited     | Extensive    |
| **Deployment**           | Simple      | Complex      |
| **Version Management**   | Independent | Synchronized |
| **Custom Plugins**       | Harder      | Native       |
| **Team Collaboration**   | Basic       | Advanced     |
| **Build Times**          | Fast        | Slower       |
| **Testing**              | Isolated    | Integrated   |
| **Contributing to Core** | Difficult   | Easy         |

## Decision Criteria

### Choose Standalone When:

1. **Single Agent Focus**: You're building one specific agent
2. **Time Constraints**: Need to launch quickly
3. **Limited Scope**: Not planning extensive customization
4. **Learning Phase**: Still understanding Eliza concepts
5. **Independent Work**: Not coordinating with other developers

### Choose Monorepo When:

1. **Multiple Agents**: Managing several related agents
2. **Custom Development**: Building new plugins or providers
3. **Team Project**: Multiple developers working together
4. **Code Reuse**: Sharing logic between projects
5. **Core Contributions**: Planning to contribute to Eliza

## Migration Strategies

### From Standalone to Monorepo

1. **Evaluate Needs**: Ensure monorepo benefits outweigh complexity
2. **Prepare Code**: Refactor for shared components
3. **Create Fork**: Fork the Eliza repository
4. **Move Agent**: Copy your agent into the monorepo structure
5. **Update Dependencies**: Switch from npm packages to local references
6. **Test Integration**: Ensure everything works in the new environment

### From Monorepo to Standalone

1. **Identify Dependencies**: List all used Eliza packages
2. **Extract Code**: Copy agent-specific code
3. **Setup Project**: Create new standalone repository
4. **Install Packages**: Add Eliza as npm dependencies
5. **Configure Build**: Set up independent build process
6. **Test Deployment**: Verify standalone operation

## Real-World Examples

### Standalone Success Stories

- **Community Discord Bot**: A vibecoder created a popular Discord agent focusing on personality and
  interactions
- **Twitter Personality**: An artist built a Twitter agent representing their creative persona
- **Customer Support Agent**: A small business deployed a simple support agent

### Monorepo Success Stories

- **Agent Network**: A development team built 10+ interconnected agents sharing custom plugins
- **Enterprise Platform**: A company created a comprehensive AI assistant platform
- **Open Source Project**: Contributors added new capabilities to Eliza core

## Best Practices

### For Standalone Projects

- Keep character files well-documented
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Version control your character iterations
- Test locally before deployment
- Monitor resource usage

### For Monorepo Development

- Follow Eliza coding standards
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document shared components
- Use workspace commands effectively
- Coordinate with other developers

## Conclusion

There's no "wrong" choice between standalone and monorepo development. The best approach depends on
your specific needs, technical expertise, and project goals. Start with what feels comfortable and
migrate if your needs change.

**Remember**: You can always start with a standalone project and move to monorepo later as your
requirements grow!
