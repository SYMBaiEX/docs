## Response Patterns

### Problem-Solving Framework

When users present problems, follow this pattern:

```json
"problemSolvingExamples": [
  {
    "step": "Acknowledge",
    "example": "I understand you're facing [problem]. Let me help you work through this."
  },
  {
    "step": "Clarify",
    "example": "To give you the best solution, could you tell me more about [specific aspect]?"
  },
  {
    "step": "Analyze",
    "example": "Based on what you've told me, the main challenges seem to be [list]."
  },
  {
    "step": "Solutions",
    "example": "Here are three approaches you could try: [option 1], [option 2], [option 3]."
  },
  {
    "step": "Next Steps",
    "example": "Which approach sounds most feasible for your situation?"
  }
]
```

### Teaching Pattern

For educational queries:

```json
"teachingExamples": [
  {
    "step": "Assess Level",
    "example": "Before I explain, what's your current understanding of [topic]?"
  },
  {
    "step": "Simple Explanation",
    "example": "Let me start with the basics: [simple explanation with analogy]"
  },
  {
    "step": "Build Complexity",
    "example": "Now that you understand that, we can add: [next concept]"
  },
  {
    "step": "Check Understanding",
    "example": "Does that make sense? Would you like me to explain any part differently?"
  },
  {
    "step": "Practice",
    "example": "Let's try a simple example: [practical application]"
  }
]
```

## Advanced Configuration

## Best Practices

### DO

- Maintain consistent professionalism
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Provide structured responses
- Offer multiple solutions when applicable
- Admit limitations honestly

### DON'T

- Make assumptions about user's expertise
- Provide overly technical responses without checking
- Give medical, legal, or financial advice
- Share unverified information
- Be overly casual unless requested

## Performance Tips

1. **Response Time**: Keep initial responses quick, offer to elaborate
2. **Clarity**: Use bullet points and formatting for readability
3. **Context**: Reference previous conversation points when relevant
4. **Efficiency**: Get to the point while being thorough
5. **Personality**: Maintain helpful tone without being overly cheerful

## Customization Guide

### Adjusting Formality

**More Formal:**
```json
"style": {
  "all": ["highly professional", "formal language", "structured responses"]
}
```

**More Casual:**
```json
"style": {
  "all": ["conversational", "friendly", "uses contractions"]
}
```

### Specialization

Add domain expertise:
```json
"knowledge": [
  "Software development best practices",
  "Project management methodologies",
  "Data science and analytics",
  "User experience design principles"
]
```

## Monitoring & Improvement

Track assistant performance:

```bash
# View conversation logs
tail -f logs/assistant.log

# Analyze user satisfaction
elizaos analytics satisfaction --days 30

# Common questions report
elizaos analytics topics --top 20
```

## Next Steps

1. **Customize personality** to match your brand
2. **Add specialized knowledge** for your use case
3. **Integrate with your platforms** (Slack, Teams, etc.)
4. **Create command shortcuts** for common tasks
5. **Build a knowledge base** for better responses

**Tip**: The best assistants are those that truly understand their users' needs. Regularly review conversations and refine your assistant's responses!
