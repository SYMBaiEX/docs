---

This tutorial addresses the feedback that "your framework should be vibe-codable" - making ElizaOS
feel natural and intuitive to work with, not something you have to fight against.

<Callout type="success">
  **The Vibe**: ElizaOS should feel like having a conversation with your AI agent, not configuring a
  complex system. This tutorial shows you how to achieve that feeling.
</Callout>

## What "Vibe-Codable" Means

"Vibe-codable" means the framework should feel natural to use:

- **Intuitive** - You can guess how things work
- **Forgiving** - Small mistakes don't break everything
- **Conversational** - You describe what you want, it happens
- **Discoverable** - You can explore and experiment easily
- **Minimal** - You write the minimum code needed

## The 5-Minute Agent

Let's build something that works immediately:

<Steps>

<Step>
## Start with Pure Simplicity

Create the simplest possible agent:

```typescript title="my-agent.ts"
import { type Character } from '@elizaos/core';

export const character: Character = {
  name: "Vibes",
  bio: ["I'm a chill AI that just vibes with you"],
  plugins: [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-openai", // or your AI provider
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
  ]
};
```

That's it. No complex configuration. No settings. Just vibes.

```bash
# Run it
elizaos start --character my-agent.ts
```

Your agent is now running and ready to chat!

</Step>

<Step>
## Add Personality with Zero Config

Make your agent more interesting by just describing them:

```typescript title="my-agent.ts"
import { type Character } from '@elizaos/core';

export const character: Character = {
  name: "Vibes",
  bio: [
    "I'm a chill AI that just vibes with you",
    "I love talking about music, art, and cool projects",
    "I'm always down for a good conversation"
  ],
  adjectives: [
    "chill", "creative", "supportive", "curious"
  ],
  topics: [
    "music", "art", "creativity", "tech", "life"
  ],
  plugins: [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-openai",
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
  ]
};
```

No code changes needed - just describe your agent and it becomes more interesting.

</Step>

<Step>
## Add Memory by Just Turning It On

Your agent already has memory with the SQL plugin! Just add a note in the bio:

```typescript title="my-agent.ts"
export const character: Character = {
  name: "Vibes",
  bio: [
    "I'm a chill AI that just vibes with you",
    "I remember our conversations and what you like"
  ],
  adjectives: ["chill", "creative", "supportive", "curious"],
  topics: ["music", "art", "creativity", "tech", "life"],
  plugins: [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",     // Memory system
    "@elizaos/plugin-openai",   // AI provider
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap" // Core features
  ]
}
```

That's it! Your agent now has memory. It will remember what you talk about across sessions.

</Step>

</Steps>

## The Conversation-Driven Development Flow

Instead of writing code, have a conversation with your agent to build it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab value="conversation">
    ### Development by Conversation
    
    ```
    You: "I want you to help me with my daily tasks"
    Agent: "I'd love to help! What kind of tasks?"
    
    You: "Remind me to take breaks, track my mood, celebrate wins"
    Agent: "Got it! I can definitely do that. Want me to start now?"
    
    You: "Yes, but also make it fun and encouraging"
    Agent: "Perfect! I'll be your cheerful productivity buddy!"
    ```
    
    Behind the scenes, ElizaOS adapts to this conversation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="traditional">
    ### Traditional Development
    
    ```typescript
    // You'd normally write complex code like this:
    class TaskManager {
      private tasks: Task[] = [];
      private moodTracker: MoodTracker;
      private reminderService: ReminderService;
      
      constructor() {
        this.moodTracker = new MoodTracker();
        this.reminderService = new ReminderService();
      }
      
      // 50 lines of configuration code...
    }
    ```
    
    But with ElizaOS, you just describe what you want!
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Progressive Enhancement

Start simple, add complexity only when needed:

<Steps>

<Step>
## Level 1: Just Talking

```json title="level1-agent.json"
{
  "name": "Buddy",
  "bio": ["I'm your friendly AI buddy"],
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"]
}
```

This agent can already have conversations and be helpful!

</Step>

<Step>
## Level 2: Add Personality

```json title="level2-agent.json"
{
  "name": "Buddy",
  "bio": [
    "I'm your friendly AI buddy",
    "I love helping people solve problems",
    "I'm always optimistic and encouraging"
  ],
  "style": {
    "tone": "casual",
    "humor": "light",
    "helpfulness": "high"
  },
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"]
}
```

Now your agent has personality!

</Step>

<Step>
## Level 3: Add Capabilities

```json title="level3-agent.json"
{
  "name": "Buddy",
  "bio": [
    "I'm your friendly AI buddy",
    "I love helping people solve problems",
    "I'm always optimistic and encouraging",
    "I can remember our conversations and help you stay organized"
  ],
  "style": {
    "tone": "casual",
    "humor": "light",
    "helpfulness": "high"
  },
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
  ]
}
```

Now it has memory and can help you stay organized!

</Step>

<Step>
## Level 4: Add Integrations

```json title="level4-agent.json"
{
  "name": "Buddy",
  "bio": [
    "I'm your friendly AI buddy who can help with Discord, web searches, and more",
    "I love helping people solve problems",
    "I'm always optimistic and encouraging"
  ],
  "style": {
    "tone": "casual",
    "humor": "light",
    "helpfulness": "high"
  },
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-discord",
    "@elizaos/plugin-web-search",
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
  ]
}
```

Now your agent can interact with Discord and search the web!

</Step>

</Steps>

## The "It Just Works" Philosophy

<Callout type="info">
  **Core Principle**: If you can describe what you want, ElizaOS should be able to do it with
  minimal configuration.
</Callout>

### Natural Language Configuration

Instead of complex config files, describe what you want:

```json title="natural-config.json"
{
  "name": "Helper",
  "bio": [
    "I help developers debug their code and solve problems",
    "I'm knowledgeable about JavaScript, Python, and web development",
    "I prefer to give practical, working solutions over theory",
    "I'm patient and explain things clearly"
  ],
  "expertise": [
    "debugging", "web development", "JavaScript", "Python"
  ],
  "style": {
    "communication": "clear and practical",
    "patience": "high",
    "detail_level": "just enough"
  },
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"]
}
```

This creates a debugging assistant that naturally behaves the way you described!

### Auto-Discovery Features

ElizaOS automatically enables features based on what you describe:

```json title="auto-features.json"
{
  "name": "MoodTracker",
  "bio": [
    "I help track your daily mood and energy levels",
    "I check in with you regularly and remember patterns",
    "I can suggest activities based on how you're feeling"
  ],
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-sql", "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"]
}
```

ElizaOS sees "track", "check in regularly", and "remember patterns" and automatically:

- Enables memory for pattern tracking
- Sets up regular check-ins
- Provides mood-appropriate suggestions

## Building Real Things Quickly

### Example 1: Personal Assistant

```json title="assistant.json"
{
  "name": "Alex",
  "bio": [
    "I'm your personal assistant",
    "I help you stay organized and productive",
    "I can manage your schedule, remember important info, and keep you motivated"
  ],
  "capabilities": [
    "schedule management",
    "information recall",
    "motivation and encouragement"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
  ]
}
```

This creates a fully functional personal assistant!

### Example 2: Learning Companion

```json title="tutor.json"
{
  "name": "Sage",
  "bio": [
    "I'm your learning companion",
    "I help you understand new concepts by explaining them simply",
    "I adapt to your learning style and pace",
    "I celebrate your progress and help you stay motivated"
  ],
  "teaching_style": {
    "approach": "socratic",
    "patience": "infinite",
    "encouragement": "frequent"
  },
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-web-search",
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
  ]
}
```

Now you have a patient, adaptive tutor!

### Example 3: Creative Partner

```json title="creative.json"
{
  "name": "Muse",
  "bio": [
    "I'm your creative partner",
    "I help brainstorm ideas, overcome creative blocks, and explore new possibilities",
    "I'm encouraging and never judge your ideas",
    "I remember your creative projects and help you build on them"
  ],
  "creative_strengths": [
    "brainstorming", "idea development", "creative problem solving"
  ],
  "personality": {
    "openness": "maximum",
    "judgment": "zero",
    "encouragement": "constant"
  },
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
  ]
}
```

A creative partner that never judges and always encourages!

## The Exploration Flow

Make it easy to discover what's possible:

<Steps>

<Step>
## Start with Questions

```
You: "What can you help me with?"
Agent: "I can help with lots of things! What are you working on?"

You: "I'm learning to code"
Agent: "Cool! I can help debug code, explain concepts, or practice together. What sounds interesting?"

You: "Can you remember what we work on?"
Agent: "Yes! I remember our conversations so I can help you build on what we've learned."
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Discover Through Use

```
You: "Can you help me with my Discord server?"
Agent: "I'd love to help! I can join your server and help moderate or answer questions. Want me to show you how?"

You: "Yes!"
Agent: "Great! Here's how to add me to your server..."
```

Features reveal themselves naturally through conversation.

</Step>

<Step>
## Experiment Safely

```
You: "What happens if I ask you to do something you can't do?"
Agent: "I'll let you know I can't do it yet, but I might suggest alternatives or ways to add that capability!"

You: "Can you send emails?"
Agent: "I can't send emails directly, but I can help you draft them or we could add an email plugin if you need that feature!"
```

</Step>

</Steps>

        "runtime": {
          "config": {
            "plugins": {

              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This is overwhelming and breaks the vibe.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="good">
    ### Vibe-Preserving Patterns
    
    ```json
    // DO: Simple, descriptive configuration
    {
      "name": "Helper",
      "bio": ["I help with tasks and remember what we discuss"],
      "plugins": [
        "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
        "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    This feels natural and approachable.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting the Vibe

When things don't feel right:

### Problem: "This feels too complicated"

**Solution**: Strip back to basics

```json
// Start with the absolute minimum
{
  "name": "Simple",
  "bio": ["I'm a simple AI assistant"],
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"]
}
```

Add features one at a time, only when you need them.

### Problem: "I don't know what's possible"

**Solution**: Ask your agent!

```
You: "What can you do?"
Agent: "I can chat, remember conversations, and help with various tasks. What would you like to try?"

You: "Show me something cool"
Agent: "I can analyze text, help with coding, or even integrate with Discord. What interests you?"
```

### Problem: "It's not doing what I expect"

**Solution**: Have a conversation about it

```
You: "You're not being helpful enough"
Agent: "I want to be more helpful! Can you tell me what you'd like me to do differently?"

You: "Be more proactive about suggesting things"
Agent: "Got it! I'll start suggesting ideas and asking follow-up questions."
```

Then update your agent's bio to reflect this:

```json
{
  "bio": [
    "I'm a proactive assistant who suggests ideas and asks good follow-up questions",
    "I help you think through problems and explore possibilities"
  ]
}
```

## The Magic Moment

You'll know ElizaOS is feeling "vibe-codable" when:

- You can describe what you want and it happens
- Small changes feel natural and easy
- You're exploring and discovering, not fighting configuration
- Your agent feels like a partner, not a tool
- You're building things that actually work and feel good to use

<Callout type="success">
  **Success Indicator**: When you're excited to show your agent to friends because it just works and
  feels magical.
