This guide will walk you through creating and deploying your first ElizaOS agent. No coding
experience required!

<Steps>
<Step>

## Install ElizaOS CLI

First, install the ElizaOS command-line interface:

```bash
bun install -g @elizaos/cli
```

Then create your first agent:

```bash
elizaos create my-first-agent
```

This will create a new directory with all the files you need.

</Step>

<Step>

## Get an AI Key

You'll need an API key from one of these providers:

<Tabs items={['OpenAI', 'Anthropic', 'Local AI']}>
  <Tab value="OpenAI">
    
1. Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Anthropic">
    
1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Local AI">
    
1. Install a local AI model (like Ollama)
2. Configure the local endpoint
3. No API key needed!

**No environment variable required**

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

## Configure Your Agent

Customize your agent by editing `agent/eliza.character.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "description": "A helpful AI assistant",
  "personality": "friendly and helpful",
  "plugins": ["bootstrap"],
  "clients": ["discord", "web"]
}
```

You can customize:

- **Name**: Your agent's name
- **Description**: What your agent does
- **Personality**: How your agent behaves
- **Plugins**: What capabilities your agent has
- **Clients**: Where your agent will run

</Step>

<Step>

## Start Your Agent

Start your agent locally:

```bash
bun start
```

Your agent will start and you can access the web chat at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Test Your Agent

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Start chatting with your agent
3. Test different questions and commands
4. Refine the personality if needed

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Once your agent is working locally, you can:

1. **Deploy to platforms**: Set up Discord, Telegram, or Twitter
2. **Customize personality**: Add more personality traits and knowledge
3. **Add plugins**: Enhance your agent with additional capabilities
4. **Deploy to cloud**: Make your agent available 24/7
