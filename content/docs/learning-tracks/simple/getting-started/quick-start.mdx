This guide will walk you through creating and deploying your first ElizaOS agent. No coding
experience required!

<Steps>
<Step>

## Install ElizaOS CLI

First, ensure you have Node.js (v23.3.0+) and Bun installed, then install the ElizaOS command-line interface:

```bash
npm install -g @elizaos/cli
```

Then create your first agent project:

```bash
elizaos create my-first-agent --type project
cd my-first-agent
```

This will create a new directory with:
- Basic project structure
- Character configuration template
- Environment file template
- All necessary dependencies

</Step>

<Step>

## Get an AI Key

You'll need an API key from one of these providers:

<Tabs items={['OpenAI', 'Anthropic', 'Local AI']}>
  <Tab value="OpenAI">
    
1. Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file

```bash
# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/db.sqlite

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Anthropic">
    
1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file

```bash
# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/db.sqlite

# Anthropic API Key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Local AI">
    
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) or another local AI
2. Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
3. Configure in `.env`:

```bash
# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/db.sqlite

# Ollama endpoint
OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

## Configure Your Agent

Customize your agent by editing `src/character.ts`:

```typescript
import { type Character } from '@elizaos/core';

export const character: Character = {
  name: "MyAgent",
  bio: [
    "A helpful AI assistant",
    "I'm here to help with any questions or tasks",
    "I love learning and helping people"
  ],
  style: {
    all: ["friendly", "helpful", "curious", "encouraging"]
  },
  topics: ["general knowledge", "problem solving", "casual conversation"],
  plugins: [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-openai",  // or your chosen AI provider
    "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"
  ]
};
```

You can customize:

- **name**: Your agent's name
- **bio**: Background and description (as an array of strings)
- **style**: How your agent communicates
- **topics**: What your agent likes to discuss
- **plugins**: Must include sql, AI provider, and bootstrap in that order

</Step>

<Step>

## Start Your Agent

Start your agent in development mode:

```bash
elizaos dev
```

Or specify a character file:

```bash
elizaos dev --character src/character.ts
```

You'll see output like:
```
ü§ñ Starting ElizaOS...
‚úÖ Database connected
‚úÖ Plugins loaded: sql, openai, bootstrap
‚úÖ Character loaded: MyAgent
üåê Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

Your agent is now running!

</Step>

<Step>

## Test Your Agent

### Via Terminal
If your agent has terminal chat enabled, you can chat directly in the console where it's running.

### Via Web Interface
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Start chatting with your agent
3. Test different questions and commands
4. Refine the personality in `src/character.ts` if needed

### Via Discord (if configured)
1. Add your bot to a Discord server
2. Chat with it in any channel it can see

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Once your agent is working locally, you can:

1. **Deploy to platforms**: Set up Discord, Telegram, or Twitter
2. **Customize personality**: Add more personality traits and knowledge
3. **Add plugins**: Enhance your agent with additional capabilities
4. **Deploy to cloud**: Make your agent available 24/7

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent won't start?**

- Check that your API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is configured in `.env`
- Verify Node.js version: `node --version` (needs v23.3.0+)
- Check Bun installation: `bun --version`
- Make sure all dependencies installed: `bun install`

**Database errors?**

- Ensure `@elizaos/plugin-sql` is the FIRST plugin in your character's plugins array
- Check DATABASE_URL format in `.env`
- For SQLite, the directory must exist

**No responses from agent?**

- Verify your AI provider API key is valid
- Check that the corresponding plugin is in your character's plugins array
- Ensure `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is the LAST plugin

**Agent not responding?**

- Check the console for error messages
- Verify your API key is valid and has credits
- Try restarting the agent
