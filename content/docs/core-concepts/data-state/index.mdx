# Data & State Management Overview

ElizaOS provides a comprehensive data and state management system built on an Entity-Component architecture. This system handles agent memory, knowledge storage, and real-time state composition for intelligent conversations.

## Core Components

### State Management
Dynamic state composition from multiple providers, enabling agents to maintain context across conversations and interactions.

### Memory System
Persistent memory storage with vector embeddings for semantic search and retrieval of conversation history and learned information.

### Knowledge Management
Structured knowledge storage and retrieval system for facts, documents, and domain-specific information.

### Database Architecture
Flexible database adapter pattern supporting multiple backends with consistent APIs for all data operations.

## Key Features

- **Entity-Component System**: Flexible data modeling with entities, components, and relationships
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic search capabilities for intelligent information retrieval
- **Memory Types**: Structured storage for different content types (messages, facts, documents)
- **State Composition**: Dynamic aggregation from multiple data sources
- **Database Adapters**: Pluggable backend support (PostgreSQL, SQLite, custom)
