# Overview

ElizaOS is built with a modular, extensible architecture that supports agent-based computing, plugin
extensibility, and real-time communication. The system is designed around a core runtime that
manages agent lifecycle, memory, and execution while providing a flexible plugin system for
customization.

## System Architecture

### Core Runtime (`@elizaos/core`)

The heart of ElizaOS is the **AgentRuntime** class, which provides:

- **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Initialization, execution, and cleanup of agent instances
- **Memory Management**: Persistent storage and retrieval of conversation history, facts, and
  knowledge
- **State Composition**: Dynamic state building from multiple providers and data sources
- **Action Processing**: Execution of agent actions and response generation
- **Plugin Integration**: Loading and management of plugins that extend agent capabilities
- **Event System**: Internal event bus for decoupled communication between components

### Client-Server Architecture

ElizaOS uses a distributed architecture with clear separation between client and server:

**Server Components (`@elizaos/server`)**:

- **HTTP API**: Express.js-based REST endpoints for agent management and system operations
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication using Socket.IO for live chat and notifications
- **Agent Management**: Multi-agent support with isolated runtime environments
- **Upload Handling**: File and media processing capabilities
- **Authentication**: Middleware for secure access control

**Client Components (`@elizaos/client`)**:

- **React Application**: Modern web interface built with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket-based chat interface with message streaming
- **Agent Management**: UI for creating, configuring, and monitoring agents
- **Memory Visualization**: Interactive views of agent memory and knowledge graphs
- **Plugin Configuration**: Interface for managing plugin settings and integrations

### Plugin System

The plugin architecture enables extensibility through standardized interfaces:

**Plugin Structure**:

```typescript
interface Plugin {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  actions?: Action[];
  evaluators?: Evaluator[];
  providers?: Provider[];
  services?: Service[];
}
```

**Core Plugin Types**:

- **Actions**: Executable behaviors that agents can perform
- **Evaluators**: Decision-making components for response evaluation
- **Providers**: Data and service integration adapters
- **Services**: System-level utilities and background processes

## Project Structure

The ElizaOS monorepo is organized into focused packages:

```
packages/
├── core/                 # Core runtime and types (@elizaos/core)
├── cli/                  # Command-line interface (@elizaos/cli)
├── client/              # Web client application (@elizaos/client)
├── server/              # HTTP/WebSocket server (@elizaos/server)
├── api-client/          # API client library (@elizaos/api-client)
├── plugin-*/            # Individual plugin packages
└── create-eliza/        # Project bootstrapping tool
```

### Package Organization

**Core Package** (`@elizaos/core`):

- `runtime.ts`: AgentRuntime class and core execution logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions for all system components
- `database.ts`: Database adapter interfaces and implementations
- `actions.ts`: Action composition and execution utilities
- `entities.ts`: Entity resolution and relationship management
- `prompts.ts`: Prompt templates and context injection
- `services.ts`: Service registry and lifecycle management

**CLI Package** (`@elizaos/cli`):

- Command implementations for project management
- Template system for project and plugin creation
- Development server with hot reloading
- Testing framework integration
- Build and deployment utilities

**Client Package** (`@elizaos/client`):

- React components for agent interaction
- Real-time communication hooks
- State management with React Context
- Plugin configuration interfaces
- Memory and knowledge visualization

**Server Package** (`@elizaos/server`):

- Express.js server with middleware
- WebSocket handlers for real-time communication
- Multi-agent runtime management
- File upload and media processing
- Authentication and authorization

## Design Principles

### Modularity and Separation of Concerns

- **Clear Boundaries**: Each package has well-defined responsibilities
- **Interface-Driven**: Components communicate through typed interfaces
- **Dependency Injection**: Services and providers are injected rather than tightly coupled
- **Plugin Isolation**: Plugins operate in isolated environments with controlled access

### Extensibility and Plugin Architecture

- **Standardized Interfaces**: All plugins implement consistent interfaces
- **Runtime Loading**: Plugins can be loaded and unloaded at runtime
- **Configuration Management**: Plugin settings are managed through environment variables
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic resolution of plugin dependencies

### Performance and Scalability

- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage with configurable limits
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations throughout the system
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections are pooled for efficiency
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of frequently accessed data

### Security and Reliability

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Environment Isolation**: Sensitive configuration is isolated from application code
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed logging for security and debugging

## Runtime Architecture

### Agent Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: Agent runtime loads character definition and plugins
2. **State Composition**: Dynamic state is built from providers and memory
3. **Message Processing**: Incoming messages are analyzed and actions are selected
4. **Action Execution**: Selected actions are executed with proper context
5. **Response Generation**: AI models generate responses based on character and context
6. **Memory Storage**: Conversation history and facts are persisted to memory

### Memory and State Management

- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic search capabilities for memory retrieval
- **Entity Resolution**: Intelligent entity identification and relationship tracking
- **Context Windows**: Efficient context management for large conversations
- **Knowledge Graph**: Structured knowledge representation with relationships

### Communication Patterns

- **Event-Driven**: Components communicate through events rather than direct calls
- **Message Bus**: Internal pub/sub system for decoupled communication
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for instant UI updates
- **API Consistency**: Unified API patterns across all endpoints

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. **Project Creation**: Use `elizaos create` to bootstrap new projects
2. **Development Server**: Run `elizaos dev` for hot reloading development
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with `elizaos test`
4. **Plugin Development**: Create and test plugins in isolation

### Production Deployment

- **Build System**: TypeScript compilation with optimized output
- **Container Support**: Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- **Environment Management**: Hierarchical configuration with secret management
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and performance metrics

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated AI agents while maintaining
flexibility, performance, and reliability.
