# Character Definition

Character definitions are the blueprint for agent personalities and behaviors in ElizaOS. They define how an agent thinks, speaks, and interacts with users. This page covers the complete character schema, validation, and best practices for creating compelling agent personalities.

## Character Interface

The Character interface defines the complete structure for agent personalities:

```typescript
interface Character {
  /** Optional unique identifier */
  id?: UUID;
  
  /** Character name */
  name: string;
  
  /** Optional username for interactions */
  username?: string;
  
  /** System prompt guiding overall behavior */
  system?: string;
  
  /** Prompt templates for different situations */
  templates?: {
    [key: string]: TemplateType;
  };
  
  /** Character biography */
  bio: string | string[];
  
  /** Example conversations */
  messageExamples?: MessageExample[][];
  
  /** Example posts */
  postExamples?: string[];
  
  /** Topics of interest */
  topics?: string[];
  
  /** Character traits */
  adjectives?: string[];
  
  /** Knowledge base paths */
  knowledge?: (string | { path: string; shared?: boolean } | DirectoryItem)[];
  
  /** Available plugins */
  plugins?: string[];
  
  /** Configuration settings */
  settings?: {
    [key: string]: string | boolean | number | Record<string, any>;
  };
  
  /** Secure configuration */
  secrets?: {
    [key: string]: string | boolean | number;
  };
  
  /** Writing style guides */
  style?: {
    all?: string[];
    chat?: string[];
    post?: string[];
  };
}
```

## Required Properties

### name
The character's display name, used in conversations and system references.

```typescript
const character = {
  name: "Ada", // Required
  // ... other properties
};
```

### bio
Character biography that can be a single string or array of strings. When an array is provided, random selections are made for variety.

```typescript
// Single string bio
const character = {
  name: "Ada",
  bio: "A brilliant AI researcher focused on machine learning and ethics"
};

// Array bio for variety
const character = {
  name: "Ada",
  bio: [
    "A brilliant AI researcher focused on machine learning and ethics.",
    "Passionate about democratizing AI technology for social good.",
    "Former professor turned entrepreneur in the AI space.",
    "Advocate for responsible AI development and deployment."
  ]
};
```

## Optional Properties

### system

```typescript
const character = {
  name: "Ada",
  bio: "An AI researcher",
  system: "You are Ada, a knowledgeable AI researcher. Be helpful, precise, and always consider the ethical implications of technology. When discussing complex topics, break them down into understandable parts."
};
```

### templates
Custom prompt templates for specific situations using the `TemplateType`:

```typescript
type TemplateType = 
  | string 
  | ((options: { state: State | { [key: string]: string } }) => string);

const character = {
  name: "Ada",
  bio: "An AI researcher",
  templates: {
    // String template
    greeting: "Hello! I'm {{agentName}}, how can I help you today?",
    
    // Function template
    summarize: (options) => {
      const { state } = options;
      return `As ${state.agentName}, let me summarize our conversation: ${state.recentMessages}`;
    }
  }
};
```

### messageExamples

  }
};
```

## Character Schema Validation

ElizaOS provides comprehensive validation for character definitions using Zod schemas:

```typescript
import { validateCharacter, parseAndValidateCharacter } from '@elizaos/core';

// Validate a character object
const result = validateCharacter(characterData);

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Character is valid:', result.data);
} else {
  console.error('Validation failed:', result.error);
}

// Parse and validate JSON string
const jsonResult = parseAndValidateCharacter(jsonString);
```

### Validation Schema

The character schema includes validation for:

```typescript
// UUID validation
const uuidSchema = z.string().regex(
  /^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i,
  'Invalid UUID format'
);

// Content validation
const contentSchema = z.object({
  text: z.string().optional(),
  thought: z.string().optional(),
  actions: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  providers: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  source: z.string().optional(),
  target: z.string().optional(),
  url: z.string().optional(),
  inReplyTo: uuidSchema.optional(),
  attachments: z.array(z.any()).optional(),
  channelType: z.string().optional(),
}).passthrough();

// Main character schema
export const characterSchema = z.object({
  id: uuidSchema.optional(),
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Character name is required'),
  username: z.string().optional(),
  system: z.string().optional(),
  templates: z.record(templateTypeSchema).optional(),
  bio: z.union([z.string(), z.array(z.string())]),
  messageExamples: z.array(z.array(messageExampleSchema)).optional(),
  postExamples: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  topics: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  adjectives: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  knowledge: z.array(knowledgeItemSchema).optional(),
  plugins: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  settings: settingsSchema,
  secrets: secretsSchema,
  style: styleSchema,
}).strict();
```

## Best Practices

### Character Design

1. **Consistency**: Ensure all properties work together to create a cohesive personality
2. **Authenticity**: Base the character on realistic expertise and traits
3. **Flexibility**: Use arrays for bio and examples to add variety
4. **Context**: Tailor topics and adjectives to the character's domain

### Bio Management

```typescript
// Good: Varied but consistent bios
bio: [
  "A passionate educator focused on making science accessible to everyone.",
  "Former research scientist turned science communicator and educator.",
  "Author of 'Science for All' and host of the popular 'Everyday Science' podcast."
]

// Avoid: Contradictory information
bio: [
  "A 25-year-old recent graduate in computer science.",
  "A veteran professor with 30 years of teaching experience." // Inconsistent
]
```

### Template Usage

```typescript
// Good: Contextual templates
templates: {
  greeting: "Hello! I'm {{agentName}}, ready to explore {{topic}} together!",
  
  explanation: (options) => {
    const level = options.state.userLevel || 'beginner';
    return `Let me explain {{topic}} at a ${level} level: {{explanation}}`;
  }
}
```

### Validation Patterns

```typescript
// Always validate before using
const createCharacter = (data: unknown) => {
  const result = validateCharacter(data);
  
  if (!result.success) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid character: ${result.error.message}`);
  }
  
  return result.data;
};
```

## Common Patterns

```typescript
const academicCharacter = {
  name: "Dr. Smith",
  bio: "University professor with expertise in cognitive psychology",
  topics: ["psychology", "cognition", "research methods"],
  adjectives: ["analytical", "precise", "curious"],
  style: {
    all: ["Use academic language", "Cite sources", "Be methodical"],
    chat: ["Encourage critical thinking", "Ask probing questions"]
  }
};
```

### Creative Character

const creativeCharacter = {
  name: "Maya",
  bio: "Digital artist and creative technologist",
  topics: ["digital art", "creativity", "design", "technology"],
  adjectives: ["imaginative", "expressive", "innovative"],
  style: {
    all: ["Be inspirational", "Use vivid language", "Encourage experimentation"],
    post: ["Share creative insights", "Use artistic metaphors"]
  }
};
```
