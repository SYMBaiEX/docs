## Core Actions Reference

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the 12 core bootstrap actions that form the
foundation of ElizaOS agent functionality. These actions are essential for agent operation and are
automatically included in the bootstrap plugin.

## Overview

Core actions handle fundamental agent behaviors including:

- **Communication**: Reply, send messages, ignore inappropriate content
- **Room Management**: Follow, unfollow, mute, and unmute rooms
- **Choice Handling**: Select options from task workflows
- **Entity Management**: Update contact information and user roles
- **Settings**: Configure agent and world settings
- **Default Behaviors**: Handle cases where no specific action is needed

## Action Structure

All core actions follow the standard ElizaOS action interface:

```typescript
interface Action {
  name: string; // Unique action identifier
  similes: string[]; // Alternative names for the action
  description: string; // When and how to use the action
  validate: (runtime, message, state?) => Promise<boolean>;
  handler: (runtime, message, state?, options?, callback?, responses?) => Promise<void>;
  examples: ActionExample[][]; // Conversation examples
}
```

---

## Choice Action

**Action Name:** `CHOOSE_OPTION`

**File:** `choice.ts`

**Description:** Selects an option for a pending task that has multiple options available.

### Properties

- **Similes:** `SELECT_OPTION`, `SELECT`, `PICK`, `CHOOSE`
- **Validation:** Requires ADMIN or OWNER role and pending tasks with `AWAITING_CHOICE` tag
- **Handler:** Uses LLM to extract task ID and option from user message

### Implementation Details

```typescript
export const choiceAction: Action = {
  name: "CHOOSE_OPTION",
  similes: ["SELECT_OPTION", "SELECT", "PICK", "CHOOSE"],
  description: "Selects an option for a pending task that has multiple options",

  validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State): Promise<boolean> => {
    // Requires proper server role and pending tasks with options
    const userRole = await getUserServerRole(runtime, message.entityId, room.serverId);
    if (userRole !== "OWNER" && userRole !== "ADMIN") return false;

    const pendingTasks = await runtime.getTasks({
      roomId: message.roomId,
      tags: ["AWAITING_CHOICE"],
    });

    return pendingTasks?.length > 0 && pendingTasks.some((task) => task.metadata?.options);
  },
};
```

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// User selects a task option
User: "post";
Agent: "Selected option: post for task: Confirm Twitter Post";

// User cancels a task
User: "I choose cancel";
Agent: "Task 'Confirm Twitter Post' has been cancelled.";
```

### Template Processing

The action uses an LLM template to extract task selection:

```typescript
const optionExtractionTemplate = `# Task: Extract selected task and option from user message

# Available Tasks:
{{#each tasks}}
Task ID: {{taskId}} - {{name}}
Available options:
{{#each options}}
- {{name}}: {{description}}
{{/each}}
- ABORT: Cancel this task
{{/each}}

# Instructions:
1. Review the user's message and identify which task and option they are selecting
2. Return the task ID and selected option name exactly as listed
3. If no clear selection is made, return null for both fields

Return in JSON format:
{
  "taskId": "string" | null,
  "selectedOption": "OPTION_NAME" | null
}`;
```

## Follow Room Action

**Action Name:** `FOLLOW_ROOM`

**File:** `followRoom.ts`

**Description:** Start following a channel with great interest, allowing the agent to chime in
without needing explicit mentions.

### Properties

- **Similes:** `FOLLOW_CHAT`, `FOLLOW_CHANNEL`, `FOLLOW_CONVERSATION`, `FOLLOW_THREAD`
- **Validation:** Checks for follow-related keywords and ensures room is not already followed or
  muted
- **Handler:** Uses LLM to determine if following is appropriate, then sets participant state

### Implementation Details

```typescript
export const followRoomAction: Action = {
  name: "FOLLOW_ROOM",
  similes: ["FOLLOW_CHAT", "FOLLOW_CHANNEL", "FOLLOW_CONVERSATION", "FOLLOW_THREAD"],
  description:
    "Start following this channel with great interest, chiming in without needing to be explicitly mentioned. Only do this if explicitly asked to.",

  validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
    const keywords = ["follow", "participate", "engage", "listen", "take interest", "join"];
    if (!keywords.some((keyword) => message.content.text?.toLowerCase().includes(keyword))) {
      return false;
    }

    const roomState = await runtime.getParticipantUserState(roomId, runtime.agentId);
    return roomState !== "FOLLOWED" && roomState !== "MUTED";
  },
};
```

### Decision Template

```typescript
const shouldFollowTemplate = `# Task: Decide if {{agentName}} should start following this room

{{recentMessages}}

Should {{agentName}} start following this room, eagerly participating without explicit mentions?
Respond with YES if:
- The user has directly asked {{agentName}} to follow the conversation
- The conversation topic is highly engaging and {{agentName}}'s input would add significant value
- {{agentName}} has unique insights to contribute and users seem receptive

Otherwise, respond with NO.`;
```

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// User requests following
User: "hey eliza follow this channel";

      await callback(responses[0].content);
    }
    return true;
  },
};

  similes: ["GREET", "REPLY_TO_MESSAGE", "SEND_REPLY", "RESPOND", "RESPONSE"],
  description:
    "Replies to the current conversation with the text from the generated message. Default if the agent is responding with a message and no other action.",

  validate: async (_runtime: IAgentRuntime) => {
    return true;
  },

  handler: async (runtime, message, state, options, callback, responses) => {
    const allProviders = responses?.flatMap((res) => res.content?.providers ?? []) ?? [];
    state = await runtime.composeState(message, [...allProviders, "RECENT_MESSAGES"]);

    const response = await runtime.useModel(ModelType.OBJECT_LARGE, {
      prompt: replyTemplate,
    });

    const responseContent = {
      thought: response.thought,
      text: response.message || "",
      actions: ["REPLY"],
    };

    await callback(responseContent);
    return true;
  },
};
```

### Reply Template

```typescript
const replyTemplate = `# Task: Generate dialog for the character {{agentName}}.
{{providers}}

# Instructions: Write the next message for {{agentName}}.
"thought" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.
"message" should be the next message for {{agentName}} which they will send to the conversation.

Response format should be formatted in a valid JSON block:
{
    "thought": "<string>",
    "message": "<string>"
}`;
```

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Greeting
User: "Hello there!"
Agent: "Hi! How can I help you today?" [REPLY action]

Requires proper permissions and world context.

### Properties

- **Similes:** `CHANGE_ROLE`, `SET_PERMISSIONS`, `ASSIGN_ROLE`, `MAKE_ADMIN`
- **Validation:** Requires GROUP or WORLD channel type and valid server ID
- **Handler:** Uses LLM to parse role assignments and validates permissions before updating

### Implementation Details

```typescript
export const updateRoleAction: Action = {
  name: "UPDATE_ROLE",
  similes: ["CHANGE_ROLE", "SET_PERMISSIONS", "ASSIGN_ROLE", "MAKE_ADMIN"],

  validate: async (_runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory): Promise<boolean> => {
    const channelType = message.content.channelType as ChannelType;
    const serverId = message.content.serverId as string;

    return (channelType === ChannelType.GROUP || channelType === ChannelType.WORLD) && !!serverId;
  },
};
```

### Permission Logic

```typescript
const canModifyRole = (currentRole: Role, targetRole: Role | null, newRole: Role): boolean => {
  // User's can't change their own role
  if (targetRole === currentRole) return false;

  switch (currentRole) {
    case Role.OWNER:
      return true; // Owners can do everything
    case Role.ADMIN:
      return newRole !== Role.OWNER; // Admins can only create/modify users up to their level
    case Role.NONE:
    default:
      return false; // Normal users can't modify roles
  }
};
```

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Make user admin
User: "Make Alice an ADMIN";
Agent: "Updated Alice's role to ADMIN.";

// Assign multiple roles
User: "Set @alice and @bob as admins";
Agent: "Updated alice's role to ADMIN.\nUpdated bob's role to ADMIN.";

// Invalid request
User: "Ban @troublemaker";
Agent: "I cannot ban users.";

## Update Entity Action

**Action Name:** `UPDATE_CONTACT`

**File:** `updateEntity.ts`

**Description:** Add or edit contact details for a person in the conversation. Used for relating
entities across platforms.

### Properties

- **Similes:** `UPDATE_ENTITY`
- **Validation:** Always returns true (core functionality)
- **Handler:** Uses LLM to extract platform and contact information, then creates/updates entity
  components

### Implementation Details

```typescript
export const updateEntityAction: Action = {
  name: "UPDATE_CONTACT",
  similes: ["UPDATE_ENTITY"],
  description:
    "Add or edit contact details for a person you are talking to or observing in the conversation. Use this when you learn this information from the conversation about a contact.",

  validate: async (_runtime: IAgentRuntime, _message: Memory, _state?: State): Promise<boolean> => {
    return true;
  },
};
```

### Component Template

```typescript
const componentTemplate = `# Task: Extract Source and Update Component Data

{{recentMessages}}

{{#if existingData}}
# Existing Component Data:
\`\`\`json
{{existingData}}
\`\`\`
{{/if}}

# Instructions:
1. Analyze the conversation to identify:
   - The source/platform being referenced (e.g. telegram, twitter, discord)
   - Any specific component data being shared

2. Generate updated component data that:
   - Is specific to the identified platform/source
   - Preserves existing data when appropriate
   - Includes the new information from the conversation

Return a JSON object with:
{
  "source": "platform-name",
  "data": {
    // Component-specific fields
  }
}`;
```

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Update telegram info
User: "Please update my telegram username to @dev_guru";
Agent: "I've updated your telegram information.";

// Set twitter handle
User: "Set Jimmy's twitter username to @jimmy_codes";
Agent: "I've updated Jimmy's twitter information.";

// Update discord details
User: "Update my discord username to dev_guru#1234";
Agent: "I've updated your discord information.";
```

---

## Action Integration

### Plugin Registration

All core actions are exported from the bootstrap plugin:

```typescript
// packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/index.ts
export { choiceAction } from "./choice";
export { followRoomAction } from "./followRoom";
export { ignoreAction } from "./ignore";
export { muteRoomAction } from "./muteRoom";
export { noneAction } from "./none";
export { replyAction } from "./reply";
export { updateRoleAction } from "./roles";
export { sendMessageAction } from "./sendMessage";
export { updateSettingsAction } from "./settings";
export { unfollowRoomAction } from "./unfollowRoom";
export { unmuteRoomAction } from "./unmuteRoom";
export { updateEntityAction } from "./updateEntity";
```

### Usage in Agents

Actions are automatically available to agents through the bootstrap plugin:

```typescript
import { bootstrapPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap";

const agent = new Agent({
  plugins: [bootstrapPlugin], // Includes all core actions
  // ... other configuration
});
```

### Action Selection

The runtime automatically selects appropriate actions based on:

1. **Validation**: Only actions that pass validation are considered
2. **Context**: LLM evaluates which action best fits the conversation context
3. **Priority**: Some actions (like REPLY) serve as fallbacks for general responses

### Error Handling

All core actions include comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation errors**: Prevent action execution in inappropriate contexts
- **Handler errors**: Gracefully handle runtime errors with user-friendly messages
- **State errors**: Ensure consistent state management across action executions

---

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Action

1. **REPLY**: Default for general conversation responses
2. **IGNORE**: When users are hostile or conversation has ended
3. **NONE**: When responding without taking specific action
4. **FOLLOW_ROOM**: When explicitly asked to participate more actively
5. **UNFOLLOW_ROOM**: When participation is unwanted or disruptive
6. **MUTE_ROOM**: When asked to stop responding entirely
7. **UNMUTE_ROOM**: When re-engagement is requested
8. **CHOOSE_OPTION**: For task workflows with multiple options
9. **SEND_MESSAGE**: For cross-platform or cross-room messaging
10. **UPDATE_ROLE**: For permission management in groups
11. **UPDATE_SETTINGS**: During onboarding or configuration
12. **UPDATE_CONTACT**: When learning new contact information

### Action Chaining

Actions can be chained together for complex workflows:

```typescript
// Example: Reply with acknowledgment, then send message
1. REPLY: "I'll send that message now"
2. SEND_MESSAGE: Actually send the message
3. REPLY: "Message sent successfully"
```

### Performance Considerations

- Actions use different LLM models based on complexity:
  - `ModelType.TEXT_SMALL`: Quick decisions and parsing
  - `ModelType.TEXT_LARGE`: Complex response generation
  - `ModelType.OBJECT_LARGE`: Structured data extraction

- Validation is lightweight and runs frequently
- Handlers include comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes

### Security

- Role-based validation for sensitive actions (UPDATE_ROLE, UPDATE_SETTINGS)
- Input sanitization for all user-provided data
- Graceful degradation when permissions are insufficient
- Audit trails for administrative actions

This comprehensive reference covers all 12 core bootstrap actions essential for ElizaOS agent
operation. Each action is designed to handle specific aspects of agent behavior while maintaining
consistency and reliability across the platform.
