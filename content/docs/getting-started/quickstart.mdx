# Quickstart

Create your first AI agent in under 5 minutes with the ElizaOS CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v23.3.0 or higher)
- **Bun** package manager
- **API Key** from OpenAI, Anthropic, or local AI setup
- **Windows Users**: WSL 2 required

## Step 1: Install the CLI

Install the ElizaOS CLI globally:

```bash
bun install -g @elizaos/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
elizaos --version
```

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

Create a new agent project:

```bash
elizaos create my-first-agent
```

This will prompt you to choose:
- **Database**: Select `pglite` (lightweight, no setup required)
- **Model Provider**: Select `openai` (most reliable for beginners)
- **Project Type**: Select `project` (full ElizaOS application)

## Step 3: Configure Your Agent

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd my-first-agent
```

Set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Edit environment variables interactively
elizaos env edit-local

# Or manually edit .env file
nano .env
```

Add your API key:

```bash
# Required: Your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional: Logging level
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Optional: Discord integration (if needed)
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=your_discord_app_id
DISCORD_API_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
```

## Step 4: Start Your Agent

Build and start your agent:

```bash
elizaos start
```

Your agent will start and be available at:
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:3000
- **Console**: Interactive chat in your terminal

## Step 5: Test Your Agent

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Start a conversation with your agent
3. Try different questions and commands
4. Observe the responses and behavior
